Parsing of a given log file based on the given conditions and parameters like message severity, message string
Have added a log file in this project which will be parsed by the python program.

##  Project 2 (unique_integer.py)
Given a list of mixed integers and characters, where each integer is repeated twice except for one:

a. Write a program to find the one integer that is not repeating twice.
b. Write unit tests for your program.

There is no need to solve for all possible scenario (Non-English support, Unicode support, white
spaces, etc.). 

### Installation
- Install pytest testing framework using pip

### Execution
